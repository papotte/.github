Quouch, accessible at [quouch-app.com](https://quouch-app.com), is an invite-only homestay platform designed
specifically for the LGBTQIA+ community, with a focus on providing safe and inclusive accommodations for queer and
female travelers. Created by Nora, who was inspired by her own experiences with Couchsurfing, Quouch aims to offer a
safer alternative by connecting users with hosts who share similar backgrounds and values, fostering a sense of
community and understanding.

The platform supports FLINTA (female, lesbian, intersex, non-binary, trans, and agender) members, enabling them to find
reliable accommodations where they feel comfortable and respected. Quouch also has a unique feature allowing users to
filter hosts by preferences to help travelers find hosts with similar interests and personalities.

Quouch is currently in the early stages of development, with plans to expand its user base and introduce new features.
